#### Paper information

- Title : NoSQL spatial (Neo4j versus PostGIS) <br>
- Author : Bart Baas, Geographical Information Management Applications (GIMA) <br>
- Date : May 22, 2012 <br> 
- Keywords : GIS, Geo, Databases, NoSQL, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, measurements.

#### Purpose of reading

> Because I'm new to NoSQL, I'm not fully aware of its using cases, especially in geospatial. With this paper I'm trying to gain some indirect experience.
> 
> In addition, since this paper was written in 2012, the content or code it contains may differ from the present. Finding, comparing, and learning those parts is also part of the goal.
> 
> In this paper, the author compared the graph DB(Neo4j) and the relational DB(PostGIS) using osm data of  Amsterdam. I used Korea(Busan) data in the same method.
