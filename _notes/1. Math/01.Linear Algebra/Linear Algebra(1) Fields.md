**Before starting**

This post series is a summary of Mark S. Gockenbach's _Finite-Dimensional Linear Algebra_. The purpose of this series is to carefully explain vector spaces and linear operators and to show how these abstract concepts are useful in practical applications. We will prove all the properties discussed, which means we need to start with a set of basic rulesâ€”specifically, the axioms of a field. Scalars, which are used with vectors, must belong to this field.
