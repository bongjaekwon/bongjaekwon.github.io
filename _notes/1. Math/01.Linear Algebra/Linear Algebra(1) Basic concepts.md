**Before starting**

This post series is a summary of Mark S. Gockenbach's _Finite-Dimensional Linear Algebra_. The purpose of this series is to carefully explain vector spaces and linear operators and to show how these abstract concepts are useful in practical applications.

**Field**

α, β ∈ F ⇒ α + β ∈ F, αβ ∈ F.


**Vector Spaces**

u,v∈V ⟹ u+v∈V,
α∈F, v∈V ⟹ αv∈V.

We say that V is a vector space over F if and only if specific conditions are satisfied.
Also the elements of a vector space 𝑉 are called vectors, and the elements of the corresponding field 𝐹 are called scalars.
