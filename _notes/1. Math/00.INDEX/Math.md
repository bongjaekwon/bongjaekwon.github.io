> I'm not familiar with math. I've never majored in math, nor studied it deeply. But it is a field that I want to study at least once in my life. So even though it's still very slow, I finally got started. And I'm keeping my study records here for people like me.<br>

> I'm a normal person, so I can't rely on talent and genius. For me, those are fantasies. But if the purpose of studying is not bragging and bluffing, then talent doesn't matter at all.
